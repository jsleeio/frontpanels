# frontpanels

## what is this?

Go libraries and tools for dealing with instrument front panel features and
formats

## history

I had previously maintained similar tooling specific to Autodesk Eagle, but as
Eagle now seems largely unmaintained, I am switching to Kicad and taking the
opportunity to do a better version of my front panel generation software.

So. Here we are.
